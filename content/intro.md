Hey! glad to see you here. My name is David Rio and I am a computer engineer
living in Charleston, SC. I help people leverage technology to improve their
businesses or projects by building web applications, crafting data
visualizations or writing analytical tools. When I am not working I like to
ride my bike, hike or read a book. I'd love to hear from you. Please, drop me
a line to **david at drio dot org**.
