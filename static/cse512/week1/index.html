      <h2> CSE512 (Week1) </h2>
      <p> I am taking the <a
      href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse512/14wi/">cse512</a>
      from Washington University. The instructor is <a
      href="http://jheer.org/">Jeffrey Heer</a>, a regular contributor in
      the DataViz field. I decided to post here my progress, with the hope to get
      feedback and who knows, maybe motivate someone else to join me.

      <p> In the first week, we had a practical and reading
      assignments. See the class <a
      href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse512/14wi/">site</a>
      for the <a href="https://goo.gl/jZciRT">book</a>'s reference. I should warn
      you, it is not an easy one to find. Yes, you can get it from <a href="https://goo.gl/jZciRT">Amazon</a> and pay 100$ but I find that a
      bit excessive. You'll have more luck from your local University Library
      (UT in my case). I couldn't take the book home, but I was able to make
      digital copies of the first chapter. So much good stuff. If anyone out
      there has any interest, I can write up a blog post summarizing my notes.

      <p> It was a dense but interesting reading. I learned new terms that will

      I'll use the book as a reference in the future for sure.

      <p> The practical assignment involves creating a visualization for a
      dataset. A very interesting dataset actually.  Read the assignment details
      <a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse512/14wi/a1.html">here</a>.

      <h3>Design's description</h3>
      <p> The first thing you notice as you start playing with the data is the wide range of
      values you can have for the antibiotic's concentration to be effective.
      The table does a decent job communicating the data, but I think my viz
      allows users to consume the data with less cognitive effort.

      <p> We want to be able to pick one of the antibiotics,
      ideally the one that requires less concentration so we can save money
      without compromising effectiveness. We may not have the most efficient
      antibiotic and we may have to use the second best one.

      <p> I wanted to use distances for my visual encodings since those are
      processed faster by the human brain. But mapping the data directly will
      not work here because of the wide range of values in the variables. To
      solve that, instead of using linear mappings for my scales, I use
      logarithmic scales so we the separation of the values are more meaningful
      and in turn, help to communicate the data more effectively.

      <h4>Improvements</h4>
      <p>I am happy with the final result but there is room
      for improvement. I would separate the horizontal location of the three
      measurements so we make more clear collisions (two antibiotics that
      require the same concentration). If we do that, we could move the text's labels
      to the graph so we eliminate ink. I would definitely implement this if this was a
      real project.

      <p> I could add the units I am using on the axis.

      <p> I could add some color to the visual element that encodes the gram
      staining. I experimented with that but I found it hijacked some of the
      attention from the meat of the dataset, the MCIs.

      <p> Finally, there is plenty of room for improvement in the aesthetics
      department, although I don't think I'd work on that since it would not
      help make the visualization more effective, just more pretty.
